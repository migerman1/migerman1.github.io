I became interested in Data Science well over two years ago. As a startup co-founder, I've heard about the excitement of AI/ML for several years at different conferences and events, but being focused on water treatment in rural India, data-driven work seemed like a far-off fantasy. I was beginning to consider writing my PhD dissertation in January 2017 but wanted to make progress on a project for [Drinkwell](http://drinkwellsystems.com/) before beginning: a heatmap of water quality across India. This heatmap would be used to focus the efforts of Drinkwell to serve regions most impacted by water quality by visualizing publicly available water quality data. 


Without a coding background, I began learning R to generate maps of India and attempt to extract data from the ornery government website. I found [Leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) to be a fantastic library for generating maps on the OpenStreetMaps platform with the goal of future integration into [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/). I was quite excited when I was able to generate my first "thing" with maps of India broken up my different divisions using [GADM shapefiles](https://gadm.org/download_country_v3.html). But, the nightmare began when trying to use [RSelenium](https://github.com/ropensci/RSelenium) to scrape data from the incredibly finnicky government website- it was definitely not designed for data extraction. 


At the same time as my frustration began, I was fortunate to learn about the upcoming course "Introduction to Data Science" at [Lehigh University](https://www1.lehigh.edu/home) taught by [Prof. Brian Davison](http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~brian/). Prof. Davison was kind enough to let me audit the course and learn from his great lectures and guest speakers. At the same time, I discovered Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) on Coursera, which I began online. Having my PhD dissertation being the top priority during the semester, I was quite overly ambitious to attempt to learn any new material and fell woefully behind on both the content by Coursera and Lehigh. I am happy to report that I successfully defended my PhD in April 2017, presented my work at several conferences ([ACS 253](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/news-room/meeting-news-releases-spring-2017.html), [AEESP2017](https://www.aeesp.org/), and [ES17](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/mcsi/conference/)), and graduated in May.


At ACS253, I was excited to see the work by [Prof. Joel Burken](https://care.mst.edu/people/faculty/profiles/burken/) of Missouri University of Science & Technology using hyperspectral imaging of plants from drones to detect indoor air pollution. Why was this strategy employed? Indoor air pollution is frequently unknown yet can be full of carcinogenic chemicals. When groundwater is contaminated with volatile organics, vapor intrusion of the chemicals from the ground can lead to indoor air pollution. Doing extensive groundwater sampling throughout a region is time consuming and costly, and does not directly measure indoor air pollution. Entering private buildings and monitoring air quality is even more logistically challenging. By measuring subtle gradients in plant health across a region through drone-based spectral imaging and through machine learning, reliable information on indoor air quality was generated. 


This work is part of a new field of "phytoforensics" that utilizes big data available from plants to improve environmental understanding. As an environmental engineer, Prof. Burken spoke about the broad potential applications in monitoring and treating groundwater contamination plumes. Plant roots transport groundwater contaminants vertically, i.e., a groundwater to the right of a tree will yield poor plant health also on the right side of the tree. In this way tree health gradients can be used to map groundwater contaminants. What an incredible new platform. The potential for drone-based imagery to collect high frequency, high resolution data across countless industries will lead to great improvements in efficiency, productivity, and safety. 


Through applications submitted during that Spring I had been accepted into a Fellowship with [The Data Incubator](https://www.thedataincubator.com/) and was hoping to attend after graduation, but I had also earned a [$100K Pitch-to-Pilot grant from USBR](https://www.usbr.gov/newsroom/newsrelease/detail.cfm?RecordID=57296) to research a novel desalination technology in the [Brackish Groundwater National Desalination Research Facility](https://www.usbr.gov/research/bgndrf/) (BGNDRF) in Alamogordo, NM. Which led me to spend the summer of 2017 performing research in New Mexico. At the end of the summer I returned to Lehigh University for a month before going to India to work with my startup, Drinkwell, for four months into early 2018. 


Working in India with my startup was an all-day slog to improve the performance of our water treatment solutions, develop new business opportunities, upskill new hires, and shape strategy. I applied to [Metis Data Science](https://www.thisismetis.com/) and was accepted into their program after completing various coding assessments and phone interviews. Being uncertain of my time that I would return to the US and my present financial situation, I was uncertain when I would be able to attend or afford the course.


While in India in 2018, I was excited to discover the incredible work of [Global Fishing Watch](https://globalfishingwatch.org/) and [SkyTruth](https://skytruth.org/) to use publicly available datasets with landsat imagery to study the international maritime industry and environmental disasters in remote places, respectively. These two organizations have had the largest impact on my long-term interest in data science. Their work makes me dream and think about the incredible undiscovered possibilities of innovations in data collection and processing. In many remote or dangerous locations, data collection is impossible from the many logistical challenges. But, the beauty of landsat imagery and [CubeSats](http://www.cubesat.org/) is that high resolution imagery of nearly the entire world is being collected every hour.


As a social entrepreneur I often think about what can I do that will yield the largest benefit to society. I chose to focus on water treatment during my PhD because I felt that a scalable microenterprise delivering safe water could have a greater public health effect than by being an individual medical doctor- I was very close to entering Medical School. The journey with Drinkwell has been exciting and I'm happy with the current status of Drinkwell. Today many water companies are data companies focused on understanding the growing volumes of water data and identifying key insights. Attending the American Water Works Association Annual Conference & Exhibition in 2017 and 2018 (AWWA ACE17, ACE18), I was floored by [Utilis](https://utiliscorp.com/) a satellite-based leak detection that has drastically reduced the price of identifying leaks, repairing leaks, and improving municipal water services across the world. A prime example of what the fourth industrial revolution will entail.


My excitement in the potential of data science to yield long-term societal benefit has me interested in pursuing new endeavors to benefit public well-being: climate-resilient (water) infrastructure, justice in conflict zones and remote areas, mobility optimization, nuanced understandings of markets, sustainable supply chain management, and targeted identification of air pollution sources. 

Data is making the world a very exciting place, and I can't wait to jump onboard.
